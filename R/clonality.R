#' Clonality
#' 
#' Creates a tibble giving the total number of sequences, number of unique 
#' productive sequences, number of genomes, entropy, clonality, Gini 
#' coefficient, and the frequency (\%) of the top productive sequences form a repertoire_id tibble.
#' 
#' @param study_table A tibble consisting of antigen receptor 
#' sequencing imported by the LymphoSeq function readImmunoSeq. "junction_aa", "duplicate_count", 
#' and "duplicate_frequency" are required columns. Note that clonality is usually calculated from 
#' productive junction sequences. Therefore, it is not recommended to run this function using a 
#' productive sequence list aggregated by amino acids.
#' @return Returns a tibble giving the total number of sequences, number of 
#' unique productive sequences, number of genomes, clonality, Gini coefficient, 
#' and the frequency (\%) of the top productive sequence, simpson index,
#' inverse simpson index, hill diversity index, chao diversity index, and kemp diversity index
#' for each repertoire_id.
#' @details Clonality is derived from the Shannon entropy, which is calculated 
#' from the frequencies of all productive sequences divided by the logarithm of 
#' the total number of unique productive sequences.  This normalized entropy 
#' value is then inverted (1 - normalized entropy) to produce the clonality 
#' metric.  
#' 
#' The Gini coefficient is an alternative metric used to calculate repertoire 
#' diversity and is derived from the Lorenz curve.  The Lorenz curve is drawn 
#' such that x-axis represents the cumulative percentage of unique sequences and 
#' the y-axis represents the cumulative percentage of reads.  A line passing 
#' through the origin with a slope of 1 reflects equal frequencies of all clones.  
#' The Gini coefficient is the ratio of the area between the line of equality 
#' and the observed Lorenz curve over the total area under the line of equality.  
#' Both Gini coefficient and clonality are reported on a scale from 0 to 1 where 
#' 0 indicates all sequences have the same frequency and 1 indicates the 
#' repertoire is dominated by a single sequence.

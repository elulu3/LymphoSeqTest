\usage{
commonSeqsBar(
  productive_aa,
  repertoire_ids,
  color_sample = NULL,
  color_intersection = NULL,
  color = "#377eb8",
  labels = "no"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{productive_aa}{A tibble of productive amino acid sequences
generated by LymphoSeq function productiveSeq where the aggregate parameter
was set to "junction_aa".}

\item{repertoire_ids}{The names of two or more repertoire_ids in the productive_aa
list whose intersections will shown.}

\item{color_sample}{The name of a single repertoire_id in the productive_aa list whose
sequences will be colored in all repertoire_ids that they appear in.}

\item{color_intersection}{The names of two or more repertoire_ids in the productive_aa
list whose intersections will be colored.}

\item{color}{A character vector of a color name that will be used highlight a selected
repertoire_id or multiple repertoire_id intersections.}

\item{labels}{A character vector indicating whether the number of
intersecting sequences should be shown on the tops of the bars.  Options
include "yes" or "no".}
}
\value{
Returns an UpSetR bar plot showing the number of intersecting sequences
across multiple repertoire_ids.
}
\description{
Creates an UpSetR bar plot showing the number of intersecting sequences across
multiple repertoire_ids.  This function is useful when more than 3 repertoire_ids are being
compared.

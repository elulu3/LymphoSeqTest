\title{Remove sequence}
\usage{
removeSeq(study_table, sequence)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_table}{A list of data frames imported using the LymphoSeq function
readImmunoSeq.  "aminoAcid", "count", and "frequencyCount" are required columns.}

\item{sequence}{A character vector of one or more amino acid sequences to
remove from the list of data frames.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of data frames like the one imported except all rows
with the specified amino acid sequence are removed.  The frequencyCount is
recalculated.
}
\description{
Removes an amino acid sequence and associated data from all instances within
a list of data frames and then recomputes the frequencyCount.

\examples{
file_path <- system.file("extdata", "TCRB_sequencing", package = "LymphoSeqTest")
stable <- readImmunoSeq(path = file_path)
searchSeq(stable, sequence = "CASSDLIGNGKLFF")
cleansed <- removeSeq(stable, sequence = "CASSDLIGNGKLFF")
searchSeq(cleansed, sequence = "CASSDLIGNGKLFF")

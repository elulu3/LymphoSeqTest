\title{Clone tracking plot}
\usage{
cloneTrack(
  study_table,
  sample_list = NULL,
  sequence_track = NULL,
  unassigned = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_table}{A tibble of productive amino acid sequences
generated by LymphoSeq function productiveSeq where the aggregate parameter
was set to "junction_aa"}

\item{sequence_track}{An optional character vector of one or more amino acid
sequences to track. If set to NULL (default), will pull all junction_aa sequences
from the sequence matrix.}

\item{sample_map}{A character vector of one or more repertoire_ids to track.
If set to NULL (default), all repertoire_ids in the sequence matrix will be tracked.}
}
\value{
Returns a line plot showing the amino acid frequencies across
multiple samples in the sequence matrix where each line represents one
unique sequence.
}
\description{
Creates line plot tracking amino acid frequencies across multiple samples
}
\details{
The plot is made using the package ggplot2 and can be reformatted
using ggplot2 functions.  See examples below.

file_path <- system.file("extdata", "TCRB_sequencing", package = "LymphoSeqTest")

stable <- readImmunoSeq(path = file_path)

# Track clones without mapping or tracking specific sequences

# Track the top 10 clones from top.freq

           unassigned = FALSE) 

# Track clones mapping to the CD4 and CD8 samples while ignoring all others

   unassigned = FALSE)

\usage{
clonalRelatedness(study_table, editDistance = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_table}{A tibble of unproductive or productive junction
sequences or productive junction sequences.  Junction and duplicate_count are
required columns.}

\item{editDistance}{An integer giving the minimum edit distance that the
sequence must be less than or equal to. See details below.}
}
\value{
Returns a tibble with the calculated clonal relatedness for each repertoire_id.
}
\description{
Calculates the clonal relatedness for each repertoire_id in a study.
}
\details{
Clonal relatedness is the proportion of junction sequences that
are related by a defined edit distance threshold.  The value ranges from 0 to
1 where 0 indicates no sequences are related and 1 indicates all sequences
are related.

Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two sequences
are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to
transform one sequence into the other. For example, an edit distance of 0
means the sequences are identical and an edit distance of 1 indicates that
the sequences different by a single amino acid or junction.

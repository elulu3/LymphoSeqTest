\usage{
alignSeq(
  study_table,
  repertoire_ids = NULL,
  sequence_list = NULL,
  edit_distance = 15,
  type = "junction",
  method = "ClustalOmega",
  top = 150
)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_table}{A tibble consisting of antigen receptor sequences
imported by the LymphoSeq function readImmunoSeq.}

\item{sequence_list}{A character vector of one ore more amino acid or junction
CDR3 sequences to search.}

\item{edit_distance}{An integer giving the minimum edit distance that the
sequence must be less than or equal to.  See details below.}

\item{type}{A character vector indicating whether "junction_aa" or "junction" sequences
should be aligned.  If "junction_aa" is specified, then run productiveSeqs first.}

\item{method}{A character vector indicating the multiple sequence alignment method to
be used.  Refer to the Bioconductor msa package for more details.  Options include
"ClustalW", "ClustalOmega", and "Muscle".}

\item{top}{The number of top sequences to perform alignment.}

\item{repertoire_id}{A character vector indicating the name of the repertoire_id in the productive
sequence list.}
}
\value{
Performs a multiple sequence alignment object.
}
\description{
Perform multiple sequence alignment using one of three methods and output results to the
console or as a pdf file.  One may perform the alignment of all amino acid or junction
sequences in a single repertoire_id.  Alternatively, one may search for a given sequence
within a list of samples using an edit distance threshold.
}
\details{
Edit distance is a way of quantifying how dissimilar two sequences
are to one another by counting the minimum number of operations required to
transform one sequence into the other.  For example, an edit distance of 0
means the sequences are identical and an edit distance of 1 indicates that
the sequences different by a single amino acid or junction.

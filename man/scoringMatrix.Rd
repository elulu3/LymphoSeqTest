\title{Bhattacharyya matrix}
\usage{
scoringMatrix(productive_table, mode = "Bhattacharyya")
}
\arguments{
\item{productive_table}{A tibble of productive sequences generated
by the LymphoSeq function productiveSeq.  "duplicate_frequency" and "junction_aa"
are a required columns.}

\item{mode}{The mode to use for calculating pairwise similarity. Can take the values
"Bhattacharyya" or "Similarity".}
}
\value{
A data frame of Bhattacharyya coefficients or Similarity scores calculated from all
pairwise comparisons from a list of repertoire_id data frames.  Both metrics
measure the amount of overlap between two samples.  The
value ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates the sequence frequencies are
identical in the two samples and 0 indicates no shared frequencies.
}
\description{
Calculates the Bhattacharyya coefficient of all pairwise comparison from a
list of data frames.

\examples{
file_path <- system.file("extdata", "TCRB_sequencing", package = "LymphoSeqTest")
stable <- readImmunoSeq(path = file_path)
atable <- productiveSeq(stable, aggregate = "junction_aa")
bhattacharyya_matrix <- scoringMatrix(productive_table = atable, 
                                      mode = "Bhattacharyya")
similarity_matrix <- scoringMatrix(productive_table = atable, 
                                   mode = "Similarity")

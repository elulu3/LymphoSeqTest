\title{Percent similarity index}
\usage{
percentSI(sample_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample1}{A data frame consisting of frequencies of antigen receptor
sequences.  "junction_aa" and "duplicate_count" are a required columns.}

\item{sample2}{A data frame consisting of frequencies of antigen receptor
sequences.  "junction_aa" and "duplicate_count" are a required columns.}
}
\value{
Returns the similarity score, a measure of the amount of
overlap between two samples.  The value ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 indicates
the sequence frequencies are identical in the two samples and 0
indicates no shared frequencies.
}
\description{
Calculates the Percent similarity index between two groups of repertoires. Percent
similarity index, not only compares the number of similar and dissimilar species
present between two sites, but also incorporate abundance.
